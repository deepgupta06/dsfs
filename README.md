  3. In this challenge, establish if a given integer num is a Curzon number. 
  If 1 plus 2 elevated to num is exactly divisible by 1 plus 2 multiplied by num, then num is a Curzon number.

    Given a non-negative integer num, implement a function that returns True if num is a Curzon number, or False otherwise.
    Examples
    is_curzon(5) ➞ True
    # 2 ** 5 + 1 = 33

    # 33 is a multiple of 11

    is_curzon(10) ➞ False
    # 2 ** 10 + 1 = 1025
    # 2 * 10 + 1 = 21
    # 1025 is not a multiple of 21

    is_curzon(14) ➞ True
    # 2 ** 14 + 1 = 16385

    area_of_hexagon(3) ➞ 23.4

  5. Create a function that returns a base-2 (binary) representation of a base-10 (decimal) string number. 
  To convert is simple: ((2) means base-2 and (10) means base-10) 010101001(2) = 1 + 8 + 32 + 128.

      Going from right to left, the value of the most right bit is 1, 
      now from that every bit to the left will be x2 the value, 
      value of an 8 bit binary numbers are (256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1).
      Examples
      binary(1) ➞ "1"
      # 1*1 = 1
      binary(5) ➞ "101"
      # 1*1 + 1*4 = 5
      binary(10) ➞ "1010"
      # 1*2 + 1*8 = 10
